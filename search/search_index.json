After being a computer geek my whole life, I decided to become a web developer. I felt it had a combination of my love for programming and puzzles as well as the process of working with a group of like minded people. I fell in love with it almost immediately. It seemed like every day I got to do something new and interesting. Most of my work has been for a company called Sealworks Inc. They were my first client and they kept me working for a long time. All while I was taking classes from a local community college and learning from other employees at Sealworks. Resume Sealworks Inc: Freelance Dev Op Engineer I had a large array of responsibilities. I wrote python code using the Django web framework to make web apps that can be used in different projects. I worked with databases and servers to put these projects live on the web. After they went live I worked to make sure that these projects stayed live and had no bugs or errors for the users. I worked on roughly a dozen sites, each one fulfilling different criteria set forth by the clients. Some projects needed internationalization and localization. Others needed to be watched closely with an instance of the sentry error tracking software that I set up. I also created a script that keeps tabs on 30+ web sites to see if their SSL certificates needed to be renewed, and if they did I would renew them. Edge On Demand: Quality Assurance Automation Intern As part of Edge on Demand I design and execute the protocols for insuring that fully formed features go live correctly upon release. Tools like Selenium, Katalon and Cypress are used to accomplish this task. I also write scripts to insure that a level of speed is maintaned across our platform, so that we can keep our clients happy. As part of my work here I fill in where need be, whether the production team needs help to fully form a mock up of a new feature using code or if the customer service team needs code to help keep track of complaints and blockers as they come in. Burning Nights: Social Media Volunteer Managed the social media presence of Burning Nights CRPS Support, an organization dedicated to spreading awareness of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, a rare neurological condition. I consistently updated the organization's Facebook and Twitter profiles and answered all questions posed by interested parties. Sometimes this meant talking a person out of suicide or talking them through a new treatment plan.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#web-developer-dev-ops-engineer","text":"Hello World","title":"Web Developer/ Dev Ops Engineer"},{"location":"#helping-clients-achieve-their-goals","text":"After being a computer geek my whole life, I decided to become a web developer.

My name is Teige Dougherty. It is said like tiger without the r sound at the end. It loosly translates to \"good-looking hurtful\" but I prefer \"Handsome-devil\". I am what you would call a self starter. I make plans and follow them through. I was taught Java Object-oriented programming in class at my local community college, and at the time I didn't think it was something I would want to continue. I started tinkering with some python and completely fell into a rabbit hole. I started listening to podcasts and watching youtube tutorials. Flash forward a few years, I decided that I needed to get some formal education, so I looked into what I wanted to specialize in. The whole time I have been working in web development and the tech industry I have found that I love to work with code, and when I sink my teeth into a good project hours can fly by like minutes. I found this wasn't the case when it came to design however. Learning what I don't like was almost as valuable as learning what I do like. I started looking around for certifcations in back end programming and came across the University of Pennsyvania Coding Bootcamps. Specifically the one in Cyber Security. I signed up right after I saw the curriculum. It was a deep dive into anything and everything that I had fallen in love with over the past few years.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about-me","text":"Hi there. My name is Teige Dougherty.

Well you are in luck then! Cookie Clicker Command Line game (Clickie Cooker) Link to GitHub Repo I have alwasy been a gamer. Ever since Spyro the Dragon and Crash Bandicoot graced my PlayStation 1. So as I got older I started to write code to try my hand at it. It has always been a dream of mine to release something onto the app store. This was the begining of that saga. Still something that I work on in my downtime. I love playing idle clicker games like this, so I wanted to see if I got the same feeling of accomplishment out of making a clicker game as I do when I play one. SSL Cert Checker (Certal Recall) Link to GitHub Repo This project started out as something that I was working on to help Sealworks Inc manage their certifications for all of their differnt sites. Eventually it took on a life of its own. I stopped billing the hours for it and dove into it. Added in Slack notifications as well as email. It was a great project to get a firm grasp on all the differnt tools that AWS encompasses. I used a dynamodb in combination with a scheduled lambda function to run this puppy once a day. Page monitor (Domainion) Link to GitHub Repo This is another project that was born out of necessity from a company that I was working for. Edge on Demand said they needed something to see if certain parts of their sites were taking too long to load, or if they were timning. They wanted to go with the current industry Pingdom, but basically they need a proof of concept before they jumped in. I cranked this out, to show what we could do with really good data. Since then I have added more features and built it up to work on other sites. Uses requrest library and required me to learn a good deal about web design and development. All of these projects were built outside of nondisclouse projects, and I own the rights to them. Feel free to break them up and use them in your projects or to just steal the whole thing.","title":"Personal Projects"},{"location":"pp/#want-to-see-some-of-my-projects","text":"Well you are in luck then!","title":"Want to see some of my projects??"},{"location":"pp/#cookie-clicker-command-line-game-clickie-cooker","text":"Link to GitHub Repo I have alwasy been a gamer.
