Hi there. My name is Teige Dougherty. It is said like tiger without the r sound at the end. It loosly translates to "good-looking hurtful" but I prefer "Handsome-devil". I am what you would call a self starter. I make plans and follow them through. I was taught Java Object-oriented programming in class at my local community college, and at the time I didn't think it was something I would want to continue. I started tinkering with some python and completely fell into a rabbit hole. I started listening to podcasts and watching youtube tutorials. 

Flash forward a few years, I decided that I needed to get some formal education, so I looked into what I wanted to specialize in. The whole time I have been working in web development and the tech industry I have found that I love to work with code, and when I sink my teeth into a good project hours can fly by like minutes. I found this wasn't the case when it came to design however. Learning what I don't like was almost as valuable as learning what I do like. I started looking around for certifcations in back end programming and came across the University of Pennsyvania Coding Bootcamps. Specifically the one in Cyber Security. I signed up right after I saw the curriculum. It was a deep dive into anything and everything that I had fallen in love with over the past few years.
