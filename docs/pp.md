## Cookie Clicker Command Line game (Clickie Cooker)
[Link to GitHub Repo](https://github.com/teigesaccord/Clickie-Cooker)


I have alwasy been a gamer. Ever since Spyro the Dragon and Crash Bandicoot graced my PlayStation 1. So as I got older I started to write code to try my hand at it. It has always been a dream of mine to release something onto the app store. This was the begining of that saga. Still something that I work on in my downtime. I love playing idle clicker games like this, so I wanted to see if I got the same feeling of accomplishment out of making a clicker game as I do when I play one. 

## SSL Cert Checker (Certal Recall)
[Link to GitHub Repo](https://github.com/teigesaccord/Certal-Recall)

This project started out as something that I was working on to help Sealworks Inc manage their certifications for all of their differnt sites. Eventually it took on a life of its own. I stopped billing the hours for it and dove into it. Added in Slack notifications as well as email. It was a great project to get a firm grasp on all the differnt tools that AWS encompasses. I used a dynamodb in combination with a scheduled lambda function to run this puppy once a day. 

## Page monitor (Domainion)

This is another project that was born out of necessity from a company that I was working for. Edge on Demand said they needed something to see if certain parts of their sites were taking too long to load, or if they were timning. They wanted to go with the current industry Pingdom, but basically they need a proof of concept before they jumped in. I cranked this out, to show what we could do with really good data. Since then I have added more features and built it up to work on other sites. Uses requrest library and required me to learn a good deal about web design and development.

#####All of these projects were built outside of nondisclouse projects, and I own the rites to them. Feel free to break them up and use them in your projects or to just steal the whole thing
