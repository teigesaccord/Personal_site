<p><em>Hello World</em></p>
<h2 id="helping-clients-achieve-their-goals">Helping clients achieve their goals.</h2>
<p>After being a computer geek my whole life, I decided to become a web developer. I felt it had a combination of my love for programming and puzzles as well as the process of working with a group of like minded people. I fell in love with it almost immediately. It seemed like every day I got to do something new and interesting. </p>
<p>Most of my work has been for a company called Sealworks Inc. They were my first client and they kept me working for a long time. All while I was taking classes from a local community college and learning from other employees at Sealworks. </p>
<h1 id="resume">Resume</h1>
<h3 id="sealworks-inc-freelance-dev-op-engineer">Sealworks Inc: Freelance Dev Op Engineer</h3>
<p>I had a large array of responsibilities. I wrote python code using the Django web framework to make web apps that can be used in different projects. I worked with databases and servers to put these projects live on the web. After they went live I worked to make sure that these projects stayed live and had no bugs or errors for the users. I worked on roughly a dozen sites, each one fulfilling different criteria set forth by the clients. Some projects needed internationalization and localization. Others needed to be watched closely with an instance of the sentry error tracking software that I set up. I also created a script that keeps tabs on 30+ web sites to see if their SSL certificates needed to be renewed, and if they did I would renew them.</p>
<h3 id="edge-on-demand-quality-assurance-automation-intern">Edge On Demand: Quality Assurance Automation Intern</h3>
<p>As part of Edge on Demand I design and execute the protocols for insuring that fully formed features go live correctly upon release. Tools like Selenium, Katalon and Cypress are used to accomplish this task. I also write scripts to insure that a level of speed is maintaned across our platform, so that we can keep our clients happy. As part of my work here I fill in where need be, whether the production team needs help to fully form a mock up of a new feature using code or if the customer service team needs code to help keep track of complaints and blockers as they come in. </p>
<h3 id="burning-nights-social-media-volunteer">Burning Nights: Social Media Volunteer</h3>
<p>Managed the social media presence of Burning Nights CRPS Support, an organization dedicated to spreading awareness of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, a rare neurological condition. I consistently updated the organization's Facebook and Twitter profiles and answered all questions posed by interested parties. Sometimes this meant talking a person out of suicide or talking them through a new treatment plan. </p>
